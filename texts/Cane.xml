					<seg>FOREWORD</seg>
				</p>
				<p>READING this book, I had the vision of a land, heretofore sunk in the mists of muteness, suddenly rising up into the eminence of song. Innumerable books have been written about the <name type="place">South</name>; some good books have been written in the <name type="place">South</name>. This book <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the <name type="place">South</name>. I do not mean that <hi rend="italic">Cane</hi> covers the <name type="place">South</name> or is the <name type="place">South</name>’s full voice. Merely this: a poet has arisen among our American youth who has known how to turn the essences and materials of his <name type="place">Southland</name> into the essences and materials of literature. A poet has arisen in that land who writes, not as a Southerner, not as a rebel against Southerners, not as a Negro, not as apologist or priest or critic: who writes as a <hi rend="italic">poet</hi>. The fashioning of beauty is ever foremost in his inspiration: not forcedly but simply, and because these ultimate aspects of his world are to him more real than all its specific problems. He has made songs and lovely stories of his land . . . not of its yesterday, but of its immediate life. And that has been enough. How rare this is will be clear to those who</p>

				<p><pb/>FOREWORD</p>
				<p>have followed with concern the struggle of the <name type="place">South</name> toward literary expression, and the particular trial of that portion of its folk whose skin is dark. The gifted Negro has been too often thwarted from becoming a poet because his world was forever forcing him to recollect that he was a Negro. The artist must lose such lesser identities in the great well of life. The English poet is not forever protesting and recalling that he is English. It is so natural and easy for him to be English that he can sing as a man. The French novelist is not forever noting: “<quote>This is French.”</quote> It is so atmospheric for him to be French, that he can devote himself to saying: <quote>“This is human.”</quote> This is an imperative condition for the creating of deep art. The whole will and mind of the creator must go below the surfaces of race. And this has been an almost impossible condition for the American Negro to achieve, forced every moment of his life into a specific and superficial plane of consciousness.The first negative significance of <hi rend="italic">Cane</hi> is that this so natural and restrictive state of mind is completely lacking. For <name>Toomer</name>, the <name type="place">Southland</name> is not a problem to be solved; it is a field of love-</p>

				<p><pb/>FOREWORD</p>
				<p>liness to be sung: the <name type="place">Georgia</name> Negro is not a downtrodden soul to be uplifted; he is material for gorgeous painting: the segregated self-conscious brown belt of <name type="place">Washington</name> is not a topic to be discussed and exposed; it is a subject of beauty and of drama, worthy of creation in literary form.It seems to me, therefore, that this is a first book in more ways than one. It is a harbinger of the <name type="place">South</name>’s literary maturity: of its emergence from the obsession put upon its minds by the unending racial crisis—an obsession from which writers have made their indirect escape through sentimentalism, exoticism, polemic, “problem” fiction, and moral melodrama. It marks the dawn of direct and unafraid creation. And, as the initial work of a man of twenty-seven, it is the harbinger of a literary force of whose incalculable future I believe no reader of this book will be in doubt. How typical is <hi rend="italic">Cane</hi> of the <name type="place">South</name>’s still virgin soil and of its pressing seeds! and the book’s chaos of verse, tale, drama, its rhythmic rolling shift from lyrism to narrative, from mystery to intimate pathos! But read the book through</p>
				<p>[ix]</p>

				<p><pb/>FOREWORD</p>
				<p>and you will see a complex and significant form take substance from its chaos. Part One is the primitive and evanescent black world of <name type="place">Georgia</name>. Part Two is the threshing and suffering brown world of <name type="place">Washington</name>, lifted by opportunity and contact into the anguish of self-conscious struggle. Part Three is <name type="place">Georgia</name> again . . . the invasion into this black womb of the ferment seed: the neurotic, educated, spiritually stirring Negro. As a broad form this is superb, and the very looseness and unexpected waves of the book’s parts make <hi rend="italic">Cane</hi> still more <hi rend="italic"><name type="place">South</name></hi><name type="place">,</name> still more of an æsthetic equivalent of the land.What a land it is! What an Æschylean beauty to its fateful problem! Those of you who love our <name type="place">South</name> will find here some of your love. Those of you who know it not will perhaps begin to understand what a warm splendor is at last at dawn.</p>
				<p>
					<l>A feast of moon and men and barking hounds,</l>
					<l>An orgy for some genius of the <name type="place">South</name></l>
					<l>With bloodshot eyes and cane-lipped scented mouth</l>

				<p><pb/>FOREWORD</p>
				<p><name type="person">Toomer </name>is finally a poet in prose) the author gives you an inkling of his revelation. An individual force, wise enough to drink humbly at this great spring of his land . . . such is the first impression of <name type="person">Jean Toomer</name>. But beyond this wisdom and this power (which shows itself perhaps most splendidly in his complete freedom from the sense of persecution), there rises a figure more significant: the artist, hard, self-immolating, the artist who is not interested in races, whose domain is Life. The book’s final Part is no longer “promise”; it is achievement. It is no mere dawn: it is a bit of the full morning. These materials . . . the ancient black man, mute, inaccessible, and yet so mystically close to the new tumultuous members of his race, the simple slave Past, the shredding Negro Present, the iridescent passionate dream of the To-morrow . . . are made and measured by a craftsman into an unforgettable music. The notes of his counterpoint are particular, the themes are of intimate connection with us Americans. But the result is that abstract and absolute thing called Art.</p>

				<l>O cant you see it, O cant you see it,</l>
				<l>Her skin is like dusk on the eastern horizon</l>
				<l>...When the sun goes down.</l>
				<p>MEN had always wanted her, this <name type="person">Karintha</name>, even as a child, <name type="person">Karintha</name> carrying beauty, perfect as dusk when the sun goes down. Old men rode her hobby-horse upon their knees. Young men danced with her at frolics when they should have been dancing with their grownup girls. God grant us youth, secretly prayed the old men. The young fellows counted the time to pass before she would be old enough to mate with them. This interest of the male, who wishes to ripen a growing thing too soon, could mean no good to her. <name type="person">Karintha</name>, at twelve, was a wild flash that told the other folks just what it was to live. At sunset, when there was no wind, and the pine-</p>

				<p><pb/>CANE</p>
				<p>smoke from over by the sawmill hugged the earth, and you couldnt see more than a few feet in front, her sudden darting past you was a bit of vivid color, like a black bird that flashes in light. With the other children one could hear, some distance off, their feet flopping in the two-inch dust. Karintha’s running was a whir. It had the sound of the red dust that sometimes makes a spiral in the road. At dusk, during the hush just after the sawmill had closed down, and before any of the women had started their supper-getting-ready songs, her voice, high-pitched, shrill, would put one’s ears to itching. But no one ever thought to make her stop because of it. She stoned the cows, and beat her dog, and fought the other children. . . Even the preacher, who caught her at mischief, told himself that she was as innocently lovely as a November cotton flower. Already, rumors were out about her. Homes in <name type="place">Georgia</name> are most often built on the two-room plan. In one, you cook and eat, in the other you sleep, and there love goes on. <name type="person">Karintha</name> had seen or heard, perhaps she had felt her parents loving. One could but imitate one’s parents, for to follow them was the</p>
				<p>[2]</p>

				<p><pb/>KARINTHA</p>
				<p>way of God. She played “home” with a small boy who was not afraid to do her bidding. That started the whole thing. Old men could no longer ride her hobby-horse upon their knees. But young men counted faster.</p>
				<l>Her skin is like dusk,</l>
				<l>O cant you see it,</l>
				<l>Her skin is like dusk,</l>
				<l>When the sun goes down.</l>
				<p><name type="person">Karintha</name> is a woman. She who carries beauty, perfect as dusk when the sun goes down. She has been married many times. Old men remind her that a few years back they rode her hobby-horse upon their knees. <name type="person">Karintha</name> smiles, and indulges them when she is in the mood for it. She has contempt for them. <name type="person">Karintha</name> is a woman. Young men run stills to make her money. Young men go to the big cities and run on the road. Young men go away to college. They all want to bring her money. These are the young men who thought that all they had to</p>

				<p>do was to count time. But <name type="person">Karintha</name> is a woman, and she has had a child. A child fell out of her womb onto a bed of pine-needles in the forest. Pine-needles are smooth and sweet. They are elastic to the feet of rabbits. . . A sawmill was nearby. Its pyramidal sawdust pile smouldered. It is a year before one completely burns. Meanwhile, the smoke curls up and hangs in odd wraiths about the trees, curls up, and spreads itself out over the valley. . . Weeks after <name type="person">Karintha</name> returned home the smoke was so heavy you tasted it in water. Some one made a song:</p>
				<l>Smoke is on the hills. Rise up.</l>
				<l>Smoke is on the hills, O rise</l>
				<l>And take my soul to Jesus.</l>
				<p><name type="person">Karintha</name> is a woman. Men do not know that the soul of her was a growing thing ripened too soon. They will bring their money; they will die not having found it out. . . <name type="person">Karintha</name> at</p>

				<p><pb/>REAPERS</p>
				<l>Black reapers with the sound of steel on stones</l>
				<l>Are sharpening scythes. I see them place the hones</l>
				<l>In their hip-pockets as a thing that's done,</l>
				<l>And start their silent swinging, one by one.</l>
				<l>Black horses drive a mower through the weeds,</l>
				<l>And there, a field rat, startled, squealing bleeds,</l>
				<l>His belly close to ground. I see the blade,</l>
				<l>Blood-stained, continue cutting weeds and shade.</l>

				<p><pb/>NOVEMBER COTTON FLOWER</p>
				<l>Boll-weevil's coming, and the winter's cold,</l>
				<l>Made cotton-stalks look rusty, seasons old,</l>
				<l>And cotton, scarce as any southern snow,</l>
				<l>Was vanishing; the branch, so pinched and slow,</l>
				<l>Failed in its function as the autumn rake;</l>
				<l>Drouth fighting soil had cause the soil to take</l>
				<l>All water from the streams; dead birds were found</l>
				<l>In wells a hundred feet below the ground--</l>
				<l>Such was the season when the flower bloomed.</l>
				<l>Old folks were startled, and it soon assumed</l>
				<l>Significance. Superstition saw</l>
				<l>Something it had never seen before:</l>
				<l>Brown eyes that loved without a trace of fear,</l>
				<l>Beauty so sudden for that time of year.</l>
				<p>[7]</p>

				<p><pb/>BECKY</p>
				<l><name type="person">Becky</name> was the white woman who had two</l>
				<l>Negro sons. She's dead; they've gone away.</l>
				<l>The pines whisper to Jesus. The Bible flaps</l>
				<l>its leaves with an aimless rustle on her mount.</l>
				<p><name type="person">Becky</name> had one Negro son. Who gave it to her? Damn buck nigger, said the white folks' mouths. She wouldn't tell. Common, God-forsaken, insane white shameless wench, said the white folks' mouths. Her eyes were sunken, her neck stringy, her breasts fallen, till then. Taking their words, they filled her, like a bubble rising--then she broke. Mouth setting in a twist that held her eyes, harsh, vacant, staring...Who gave it to her? Low-down nigger with no self-respect, said the black folks' mouths. She wouldnt tell. Poor Catholic poor-white crazy woman, said the black folks' mouths. White folks and black folks built her cabin, fed her and her growing baby, prayed secretly to God who'd put His cross upon her and cast her out.</p>
				<p>[8]</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p><pb/> BECKY</p>
				<p>When the first was born, the white folks said they’d have no more to do with her. And black folks, they too joined hands to cast her out. . . The pines whispered to Jesus. . The railroad boss said not to say he said it, but she could live, if she wanted to, on the narrow strip of land between the railroad and the road. <name type="person">John Stone</name>, who owned the lumber and the bricks, would have shot the man who told he gave the stuff to <name type="person">Lonnie Deacon</name>, who stole out there at night and built the cabin. A single room held down to earth. . . O fly away to Jesus . . . by a leaning chimney. . .</p>
				<p>Six trains each day rumbled past and shook the ground under her cabin. Fords, and horse- and mule-drawn buggies went back and forth along the road. No one ever saw her. Trainmen, and passengers who’d heard about her, threw out papers and food. Threw out little crumpled slips of paper scribbled with prayers, as they passed her eye-shaped piece of sandy ground. Ground islandized between the road and railroad track. Pushed up where a blue-sheen God with listless eyes could look at it.</p>
				<p>[9]</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p><pb/>CANE</p>
				<p>Folks from the town took turns, unknown, of course, to each other, in bringing corn and meat and sweet potatoes. Even sometimes snuff. . . O thank y Jesus. . . <name type="person">Old David Georgia</name>, grinding cane and boiling syrup, never went her way without some sugar sap. No one ever saw her. The boy grew up and ran around. When he was five years old as folks reckoned it, <name type="person">Hugh Jourdon</name> saw him carrying a baby. “<name type="person">Becky</name> has another son,” was what the whole town knew. But nothing was said, for the part of man that says things to the likes of that had told itself that if there was a <name type="person">Becky</name>, that <name type="person">Becky</name> now was dead.</p>
				<p>The two boys grew. Sullen and cunning. . . O pines, whisper to Jesus; tell Him to come and press sweet Jesus-lips against their lips and eyes. . . It seemed as though with those two big fellows there, there could be no room for <name type="person">Becky</name>. The part that prayed wondered if perhaps she’d really died, and they had buried her. No one dared ask. They’d beat and cut a man who meant nothing at all in mentioning that they lived along the road. White or colored?</p>
				<p>[10]</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p><pb/> BECKY</p>
				<p>No one knew, and least of all themselves. They drifted around from job to job. We, who had cast out their mother because of them, could we take them in? They answered black and white folks by shooting up two men and leaving town. “Godam the white folks; godam the niggers,” they shouted as they left town. <name type="person">Becky</name>? Smoke curled up from her chimney; she must be there. Trains passing shook the ground. The ground shook the leaning chimney. Nobody noticed it. A creepy feeling came over all who saw that thin wraith of smoke and felt the trembling of the ground. Folks began to take her food again. They quit it soon because they had a fear. <name type="person">Becky</name> if dead might be a hant, and if alive—it took some nerve even to mention it. . . O pines, whisper to Jesus. . .</p>
				<p>It was Sunday. Our congregation had been visiting at <name type="person">Pulverton</name>, and were coming home. There was no wind. The autumn sun, the bell from Ebenezer Church, listless and heavy. Even the pines were stale, sticky, like the smell of food that makes you sick. Before we turned the bend of the road that would show us the <name type="person">Becky</name> cabin,</p>

				<p>the horses stopped stock-still, pushed back their ears, and nervously whinnied. We urged, then whipped them on. Quarter of a mile away thin smoke curled up from the leaning chimney. . . O pines, whisper to Jesus. . . Goose-flesh came on my skin though there still was neither chill nor wind. Eyes left their sockets for the cabin. Ears burned and throbbed. Uncanny eclipse! fear closed my mind. We were just about to pass. . . Pines shout to Jesus! . . the ground trembled as a ghost train rumbled by. The chimney fell into the cabin. Its thud was like a hollow report, ages having passed since it went off. Barlo and I were pulled out of our seats. Dragged to the door that had swung open. Through the dust we saw the bricks in a mound upon the floor. <name type="person">Becky</name>, if she was there, lay under them. I thought I heard a groan. <name type="person">Barlo</name>, mumbling something, threw his Bible on the pile. (No one has ever touched it.) Somehow we got away. My buggy was still on the road. The last thing that I remember was whipping old <name type="person">Dan</name> like fury; I remember nothing after that—that is, until I reached town and</p>

It bumps, and groans, and shakes as it crosses the railroad track. She, riding it easy. I leave the men around the stove to follow her with my eyes down the red dust road. Nigger woman driving a Georgia chariot down an old dust road. Dixie Pike is what they call it. Maybe she feels my gaze, perhaps she expects it. Anyway, she turns. The sun, which has been slanting over her shoulder, shoots primitive rockets into her mangrove-gloomed, yellow flower face. Hi! Yip! God has left the Moses-people for the nigger. “Gedap.” Using reins to slap the mule, she disappears in a cloudy rumble at some indefinite point along the road.</p>

				<p>(The sun is hammered to a band of gold. Pine-needles, like mazda, are brilliantly aglow. No rain has come to take the rustle from the falling sweet-gum leaves. Over in the forest, across the swamp, a sawmill blows its closing whistle. Smoke curls up. Marvelous web spun by the spider sawdust pile. Curls up and spreads itself pine-high above the branch, a single silver band along the eastern valley. A black boy . . . you are the most sleepiest man I ever seed, Sleeping Beauty . . . cradled on a gray mule, guided by the hollow sound of cowbells, heads for them through a rusty cotton field. From down the railroad track, the chug-chug of a gas engine announces that the repair gang is coming home. A girl in the yard of a whitewashed shack not much larger than the stack of worn ties piled before it, sings. Her voice is loud. Echoes, like rain, sweep the valley. Dusk takes the polish from the rails. Lights twinkle in scattered houses. From far away, a sad strong song. Pungent and composite, the smell of farmyards is the fragrance of the woman. She does not sing; her body is a song. She is in the forest, dancing. Torches</p>

				<p>Carma’s tale is the crudest melodrama. Her husband’s in the gang. And its her fault he got there. Working with a contractor, he was away most of the time. She had others.

They put them out. Really, because she still might be live enough to shoot. Time and space have no meaning in a canefield. No more than the interminable stalks. . . Some one stumbled over her. A cry went up. From the road, one would have thought that they were cornering a rabbit or a skunk. . . It is difficult carrying dead weight through cane. They placed her on the sofa. A curious, nosey somebody looked for the wound. This fussing with her clothes aroused her. Her eyes were weak and pitiable for so strong a woman. Slowly, then like a flash, <name type="person">Bane</name> came to know that the shot she fired, with averted head, was aimed to whistle like a dying hornet through the cane.

				<p>FACE flowed into her eyes. Flowed in soft cream foam and plaintive ripples, in such a way that wherever your glance may momentarily have rested, it immediately thereafter wavered in the direction of her eyes. The soft suggestion of down slightly darkened, like the shadow of a bird’s wing might, the creamy brown color of her upper lip. Why, after noticing it, you sought her eyes, I cannot tell you. Her nose was aquiline, Semitic. If you have heard a Jewish cantor sing, if he has touched you and made your own sorrow seem trivial when compared with his, you will know my feeling when I follow the curves of her profile, like mobile rivers, to their common delta. They were strange eyes. In this, that they sought nothing—that is, nothing that was obvious and tangible and that one could see, and they gave the impression that nothing was to be denied. When a woman seeks, you will have observed, her eyes deny. Fern’s eyes desired nothing that you</p>

				<p><pb/>FERN</p>
				<p>could give her; there was no reason why they should withhold. Men saw her eyes and fooled themselves. Fern’s eyes said to them that she was easy. When she was young, a few men took her, but got no joy from it. And then, once done, they felt bound to her (quite unlike their hit and run with other girls), felt as though it would take them a lifetime to fulfill an obligation which they could find no name for. They became attached to her, and hungered after finding the barest trace of what she might desire. As she grew up, new men who came to town felt as almost everyone did who ever saw her: that they would not be denied. Men were everlastingly bringing her their bodies. Something inside of her got tired of them, I guess, for I am certain that for the life of her she could not tell why or how she began to turn them off. A man in fever is no trifling thing to send away. They began to leave her, baffled and ashamed, yet vowing to themselves that some day they would do some fine thing for her: send her candy every week and not let her know whom it came from, watch out for her wedding-day and give her a magnificent something with no name on it, buy</p>

				<p>a house and deed it to her, rescue her from some unworthy fellow who had tricked her into marrying him. As you know, men are apt to idolize or fear that which they cannot understand, especially if it be a woman. She did not deny them, yet the fact was that they were denied. A sort of superstition crept into their consciousness of her being somehow above them. Being above them meant that she was not to be approached by anyone. She became a virgin. Now a virgin in a small southern town is by no means the usual thing, if you will believe me. That the sexes were made to mate is the practice of the South. Particularly, black folks were made to mate. And it is black folks whom I have been talking about thus far. What white men thought of <name type="person">Fern</name> I can arrive at only by analogy. They let her alone.</p>
				<p>Anyone, of course, could see her, could see her eyes. If you walked up the Dixie Pike most any time of day, you’d be most like to see her resting listless-like on the railing of her porch, back propped against a post, head tilted a little forward because there was a nail in the porch</p>

				<p>post just where her head came which for some reason or other she never took the trouble to pull out. Her eyes, if it were sunset, rested idly where the sun, molten and glorious, was pouring down between the fringe of pines. Or maybe they gazed at the gray cabin on the knoll from which an evening folk-song was coming. Perhaps they followed a cow that had been turned loose to roam and feed on cotton-stalks and corn leaves. Like as not they’d settle on some vague spot above the horizon, though hardly a trace of wistfulness would come to them. If it were dusk, then they’d wait for the search-light of the evening train which you could see miles up the track before it flared across the Dixie Pike, close to her home. Wherever they looked, you’d follow them and then waver back. Like her face, the whole countryside seemed to flow into her eyes. Flowed into them with the soft listless cadence of Georgia’s South. A young Negro, once, was looking at her, spellbound, from the road. A white man passing in a buggy had to flick him with his whip if he was to get by without running him over. I first saw her on her porch. I was passing with a fellow whose crusty numb-</p>

I asked him who she was. “That’s <name>Fern</name>,” was all that I could get from him. Some folks already thought that I was given to nosing around; I let it go at that, so far as questions were concerned. But at first sight of her I felt as if I heard a Jewish cantor sing. As if his singing rose above the unheard chorus of a folk-song. And I felt bound to her. I too had my dreams: something I would do for her. I have knocked about from town to town too much not to know the futility of mere change of place. Besides, picture if you can, this cream-colored solitary girl sitting at a tenement window looking down on the indifferent throngs of <name type="place">Harlem</name>. Better that she listen to folk-songs at dusk in <name type="place">Georgia</name>, you would say, and so would I. Or, suppose she came up North and married. Even a doctor or a lawyer, say, one who would be sure to get along—that is, make money.

See her move into a southern town where white men are more aggressive. See her become a white man’s concubine. . . Something I must do for her. There was myself. What could I do for her? Talk, of course. Push back the fringe of pines upon new horizons. To what purpose? and what for? Her? Myself? Men in her case seem to lose their selfishness. I lost mine before I touched her. I ask you, friend (it makes no difference if you sit in the Pullman or the Jim Crow as the train crosses her road), what thoughts would come to you—that is, after you’d finished with the thoughts that leap into men’s minds at the sight of a pretty woman who will not deny them; what thoughts would come to you, had you seen her in a quick flash, keen and intuitively, as she sat there on her porch when your train thundered by? Would you have got off at the next station and come back for her to take her where? Would you have</p>

Would you tell your wife or sweetheart about a girl you saw? Your thoughts can help me, and I would like to know. Something I would do for her. . .</p>
				<p>One evening I walked up the Pike on purpose, and stopped to say hello. Some of her family were about, but they moved away to make room for me. Damn if I knew how to begin. Would you? Mr. and Miss So-and-So, people, the weather, the crops, the new preacher, the frolic, the church benefit, rabbit and possum hunting, the new soft drink they had at old Pap’s store, the schedule of the trains, what kind of town <name type="place">Macon</name> was, Negro’s migration north, boll-weevils, syrup, the Bible—to all these things she gave a yassur or nassur, without further comment. I began to wonder if perhaps my own emotional sensibility had played one of its tricks on me. “Lets take a walk,” I at last ventured. The suggestion, coming after so long an isolation, was novel enough, I guess, to surprise. But it wasnt that. Something told me that men</p>

				<p>before me had said just that as a prelude to the offering of their bodies. I tried to tell her with my eyes. I think she understood. The thing from her that made my throat catch, vanished. Its passing left her visible in a way I’d thought, but never seen. We walked down the Pike with people on all the porches gaping at us. “Doesnt it make you mad?” She meant the row of petty gossiping people. She meant the world. Through a canebrake that was ripe for cutting, the branch was reached. Under a sweet-gum tree, and where reddish leaves had dammed the creek a little, we sat down. Dusk, suggesting the almost imperceptible procession of giant trees, settled with a purple haze about the cane. I felt strange, as I always do in Georgia, particularly at dusk. I felt that things unseen to men were tangibly immediate. It would not have surprised me had I had vision. People have them in <name type="place">Georgia</name> more often than you would suppose. A black woman once saw the mother of Christ and drew her in charcoal on the courthouse wall. . . When one is on the soil of one’s ancestors, most anything can come to one. . . From force of habit, I suppose, I held <name type="person">Fern</name> in</p>

				<p>my arms—that is, without at first noticing it. Then my mind came back to her. Her eyes, unusually weird and open, held me. Held God. He flowed in as I’ve seen the countryside flow in. Seen men. I must have done something—what, I dont know, in the confusion of my emotion. She sprang up. Rushed some distance from me. Fell to her knees, and began swaying, swaying. Her body was tortured with something it could not let out. Like boiling sap it flooded arms and fingers till she shook them as if they burned her. It found her throat, and spattered inarticulately in plaintive, convulsive sounds, mingled with calls to Christ Jesus. And then she sang, brokenly. A Jewish cantor singing with a broken voice. A child’s voice, uncertain, or an old man’s. Dusk hid her; I could hear only her song. It seemed to me as though she were pounding her head in anguish upon the ground. I rushed to her. She fainted in my arms.</p>

From the train window I saw her as I crossed her road. Saw her on her porch, head tilted a little forward where the nail was, eyes vaguely focused on the sunset. Saw her face flow into them, the countryside and something that I call God, flowing into them. . . Nothing ever really happened. Nothing ever came to Fern, not even I. Something I would do for her. Some fine unnamed thing. . . And, friend, you? She is still living, I have reason to know. Her name, against the chance that you might happen down that way, is <name>Fernie May Rosen.</name></p>

From the street some one shouts, “<name type="person">King Barlo</name> has come back to town.” He passes her window, driving a large new car. Cut-out open. He veers to the curb, and steps out. Barlo has made money on cotton during the war. He is as rich as anyone. <name type="person">Esther</name> suddenly is animate. She goes to her door. She sees him at a distance, the center of a group of credulous men. She hears the deep-bass rumble of his talk. The sun swings low. McGregor’s windows are aflame again. Pale flame. A sharply dressed white girl passes by. For a moment <name type="person">Esther</name> wishes that she might be like her. Not white; she has no need for being that. But sharp, sporty, with get-up about her. <name type="person">Barlo</name> is connected with that wish. She mustnt wish. Wishes only make you restless. Emptiness is a thing that grows by being moved. “I’ll not think. Not wish. Just set my mind against it.” Then the thought comes to her that those purposeless, easy-going men will possess him, if she doesnt. Purpose is not dead in her, now that she comes to think of it. That loose women will have their arms around him at Nat Bowle’s</p>

				<p>place to-night. As if her veins are full of fired sun-bleached southern shanties, a swift heat sweeps them. Dead dreams, and a forgotten resolution are carried upward by the flames. Pale flames. “They shant have him. Oh, they shall not. Not if it kills me they shant have him.” Jerky, aflutter, she closes the store and starts home. Folks lazing on store windowsills wonder what on earth can be the matter with Jim Crane’s gal, as she passes them. “Come to remember, she always was a little off, a little crazy, I reckon.” <name type="person">Esther</name> seeks her own room, and locks the door. Her mind is a pink mesh-bag filled with baby toes.</p>
				<p>Using the noise of the town clock striking twelve to cover the creaks of her departure, <name type="person">Esther</name> slips into the quiet road. The town, her parents, most everyone is sound asleep. This fact is a stable thing that comforts her. After sundown a chill wind came up from the west. It is still blowing, but to her it is a steady, settled thing like the cold. She wants her mind to be like that. Solid, contained, and blank as a sheet of darkened ice. She will not permit herself to</p>

				<p>notice the peculiar phosphorescent glitter of the sweet-gum leaves. Their movement would excite her. Exciting too, the recession of the dull familiar homes she knows so well. She doesnt know them at all. She closes her eyes, and holds them tightly. Wont do. Her being aware that they are closed recalls her purpose. She does not want to think of it. She opens them. She turns now into the deserted business street. The corrugated iron canopies and mule- and horse- gnawed hitching posts bring her a strange composure. Ghosts of the commonplaces of her daily life take stride with her and become her companions. And the echoes of her heels upon the flagging are rhythmically monotonous and soothing. Crossing the street at the corner of McGregor’s notion shop, she thinks that the windows are a dull flame. Only a fancy. She walks faster. Then runs. A turn into a side street brings her abruptly to Nat Bowle’s place. The house is squat and dark. It is always dark. <name type="person">Barlo</name> is within. Quietly she opens the outside door and steps in. She passes through a small room. Pauses before a flight of stairs down which people’s voices, muffled, come. The air</p>

Blackness rushes to her eyes. And then she finds that she is in a large room. <name type="person">Barlo</name> is before her.</p>
				<p>“Well, I’m sholy damned—skuse me, but what, what brought you here, lil milk-white gal?”</p>
				<p>“You.” Her voice sounds like a frightened child’s that calls homeward from some point miles away.</p>

				<p>“Yes, you <name type="person">Barlo</name>.”</p>
				<p>“This aint th place fer y. This aint th place fer y.”</p>
				<p>“I know. I know. But I’ve come for you.”</p>
				<p>“For me for what?”</p>
				<p>She manages to look deep and straight into his eyes. He is slow at understanding. Guffaws and giggles break out from all around the room. A coarse woman’s voice remarks, “So thats how th dictie niggers does it.” Laughs. “Mus give em credit fo their gall.”</p>

The thought comes suddenly, that conception with a drunken man must be a mighty sin. She draws away, frozen. Like a somnambulist she wheels around and walks stiffly to the stairs. Down them.

				<p>1</p>
				<p>UP from the skeleton stone walls, up from the rotting floor boards and the solid hand-hewn beams of oak of the pre-war cotton factory, dusk came. Up from the dusk the full moon came. Glowing like a fired pine-knot, it illumined the great door and soft showered the Negro shanties aligned along the single street of factory town. The full moon in the great door was an omen. Negro women improvised songs against its spell.</p>
				<p><name type="person">Louisa</name> sang as she came over the crest of the hill from the white folks’ kitchen. Her skin was the color of oak leaves on young trees in fall. Her breasts, firm and up-pointed like ripe acorns. And her singing had the low murmur of winds in fig trees. <name type="person">Bob Stone</name>, younger son of the people she worked for, loved her. By the way the world reckons things, he had won her. By measure of that warm glow which came into her mind at thought of him, he had won her.</p>

				<p><pb/>CANE</p>
				<p><name type="person">Tom Burwell</name>, whom the whole town called <name type="person">Big Boy</name>, also loved her. But working in the fields all day, and far away from her, gave him no chance to show it. Though often enough of evenings he had tried to. Somehow, he never got along. Strong as he was with hands upon the ax or plow, he found it difficult to hold her. Or so he thought. But the fact was that he held her to factory town more firmly than he thought for. His black balanced, and pulled against, the white of Stone, when she thought of them. And her mind was vaguely upon them as she came over the crest of the hill, coming from the white folks’ kitchen. As she sang softly at the evil face of the full moon.</p>
				<p>A strange stir was in her. Indolently, she tried to fix upon <name type="person">Bob</name> or <name type="person">Tom</name> as the cause of it. To meet <name type="person">Bob</name> in the canebrake, as she was going to do an hour or so later, was nothing new. And Tom’s proposal which she felt on its way to her could be indefinitely put off. Separately, there was no unusual significance to either one. But for some reason, they jumbled when her eyes gazed vacantly at the rising moon. And from the jumble came the stir that was strangely with-</p>

				<p>in her. Her lips trembled. The slow rhythm of her song grew agitant and restless. Rusty black and tan spotted hounds, lying in the dark corners of porches or prowling around back yards, put their noses in the air and caught its tremor. They began plaintively to yelp and howl. Chickens woke up and cackled. Intermittently, all over the countryside dogs barked and roosters crowed as if heralding a weird dawn or some ungodly awakening. The women sang lustily. Their songs were cotton-wads to stop their ears. <name type="person">Louisa</name> came down into factory town and sank wearily upon the step before her home. The moon was rising towards a thick cloud-bank which soon would hide it.</p>

				<p>Up from the deep dusk of a cleared spot on the edge of the forest a mellow glow arose and spread fan-wise into the low-hanging heavens. And all around the air was heavy with the scent</p>
				<p>[53]</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p><pb/>CANE</p>
				<p>of boiling cane. A large pile of cane-stalks lay like ribboned shadows upon the ground. A mule, harnessed to a pole, trudged lazily round and round the pivot of the grinder. Beneath a swaying oil lamp, a Negro alternately whipped out at the mule, and fed cane-stalks to the grinder. A fat boy waddled pails of fresh ground juice between the grinder and the boiling stove. Steam came from the copper boiling pan. The scent of cane came from the copper pan and drenched the forest and the hill that sloped to factory town, beneath its fragrance. It drenched the men in circle seated around the stove. Some of them chewed at the white pulp of stalks, but there was no need for them to, if all they wanted was to taste the cane. One tasted it in factory town. And from factory town one could see the soft haze thrown by the glowing stove upon the low-hanging heavens.</p>
				<p><name type="person">Old David Georgia</name> stirred the thickening syrup with a long ladle, and ever so often drew it off. <name type="person">Old David Georgia</name> tended his stove and told tales about the white folks, about moon- shining and cotton picking, and about sweet nigger gals, to the men who sat there about his</p>

Till some one said something about<name type="person"> Louisa </name>and <name type="person">Bob Stone</name>, about the silk stockings she must have gotten from him. Blood ran up Tom’s neck hotter than the glow that flooded from the stove. He sprang up. Glared at the men and said, “She’s my gal.” <name type="person">Will Manning</name> laughed. <name type="person">Tom</name> strode over to him. Yanked him up and knocked him to the ground. Several of Manning’s friends got up to fight for him. <name type="person">Tom</name> whipped out a long knife and would have cut them to shreds if they hadnt ducked into the woods. <name type="person">Tom</name> had had enough. He nodded to <name type="person">Old David Georgia</name> and swung down the path to factory town. Just then, the dogs started barking and the roosters began to crow. <name type="person">Tom</name> felt funny. Away from the fight, away from the stove, chill got to him. He shivered. He shuddered when he saw the full moon rising towards the cloud-bank. He who didnt give a godam for the fears of old women.

The full moon sank upward into the deep purple of the cloud-bank. An old woman brought a lighted lamp and hung it on the common well whose bulky shadow squatted in the middle of the road, opposite <name type="person">Tom</name> and <name type="person">Louisa</name>. The old woman lifted the well-lid, took hold the chain, and began drawing up the heavy bucket. As she did so, she sang. Figures shifted, restless- like, between lamp and window in the front rooms of the shanties. Shadows of the figures fought each other on the gray dust of the road. Figures raised the windows and joined the old woman in song. <name type="person">Louisa</name> and <name type="person">Tom</name>, the whole street, singing:</p>

				<p>the gloom of fir trees and magnolias. The clear white of his skin paled, and the flush of his cheeks turned purple. As if to balance this outer change, his mind became consciously a white man’s. He passed the house with its huge open hearth which, in the days of slavery, was the plantation cookery. He saw Louisa bent over that hearth. He went in as a master should and took her. Direct, honest, bold. None of this sneaking that he had to go through now. The contrast was repulsive to him. His family had lost ground. Hell no, his family still owned the niggers, practically. Damned if they did, or he wouldnt have to duck around so. What would they think if they knew? His mother? His sister? He shouldnt mention them, shouldnt think of them in this connection. There in the dusk he blushed at doing so. Fellows about town were all right, but how about his friends up North? He could see them incredible, repulsed. They didnt know. The thought first made him laugh. Then, with their eyes still upon him, he began to feel embarrassed. He felt the need of explaining things to them. Explain hell. They wouldnt understand, and moreover, who ever</p>

Not a twig cracked beneath his feet. He reached the path that led to factory town. Plunged furiously down it. Halfway along, a blindness within him veered him aside. He crashed into the bordering canebrake. Cane leaves cut his face and lips. He tasted blood. He threw himself down and dug his fingers in the ground. The earth was cool. Cane-roots took the fever from his hands. After a long while, or so it seemed to him, the thought came to him that it must be time to see <name type="person">Louisa</name>. He got to his feet and walked calmly to their meeting place. No <name type="person">Louisa</name>. <name type="person">Tom Burwell</name> had her. Veins in his forehead bulged and distended. Saliva moistened the dried blood on his lips. He bit down on his lips. He tasted blood. Not his own blood; Tom Burwell’s blood. <name type="person">Bob</name> drove through the cane and out again upon the road.

				<p>rushing made him stumble over it. He fell with a thud that dazed him. The hound yelped. Answering yelps came from all over the countryside. Chickens cackled. Roosters crowed, heralding the bloodshot eyes of southern awakening. Singers in the town were silenced. They shut their windows down. Palpitant between the rooster crows, a chill hush settled upon the huddled forms of <name type="person">Tom</name> and <name type="person">Louisa</name>. A figure rushed from the shadow and stood before them. <name type="person">Tom</name> popped to his feet.</p>

				<p>“Thats my game, sho.”</p>
				<p>Blue flash, a steel blade slashed across Bob Stone’s throat. He had a sweetish sick feeling. Blood began to flow. Then he felt a sharp twitch of pain. He let his knife drop. He slapped one hand against his neck. He pressed the other on top of his head as if to hold it down. He groaned. He turned, and staggered towards the crest of the hill in the direction of white town. Negroes who had seen the fight slunk into their homes and blew the lamps out. <name type="person">Louisa</name>, dazed, hysterical, refused to go indoors.

The moving body of their silence preceded them over the crest of the hill into factory town. It flattened the Negroes beneath it. It rolled to the wall of the factory, where it stopped.

A yell went up from the mob. <name type="person">Tom</name> wheeled about and faced them. They poured down on him. They swarmed.

Nails scratches let little lines of blood trickle down and mat into the hair. His face, his eyes were set and stony. Except for irregular breathing, one would have thought him already dead.

Ghost of a yell slipped through the flames and out the great door of the factory. It fluttered like a dying thing down the single street of factory town. <name type="person">Louisa</name>, upon the step before her home, did not hear it, but her eyes opened slowly. They saw the full moon glowing in the great door. The full moon, an evil thing, an omen, soft showering the homes of folks she knew. Where were they, these people?

				<p>FOR a long while she was nothing more to me than one of those skirted beings whom boys at a certain age disdain to play with. Just how I came to love her, timidly, and with secret blushes, I do not know. But that I did was brought home to me one night, the first night that <name type="person">Ned</name> wore his long pants. Us fellers were seated on the curb before an apartment house where she had gone in. The young trees had not outgrown their boxes then.<name type="place"> V Street</name> was lined with them. When our legs grew cramped and stiff from the cold of the stone, we’d stand around a box and whittle it. I like to think now that there was a hidden purpose in the way we hacked them with our knives. I like to feel that something deep in me responded to the trees, the young trees that whinnied like colts impatient to be let free. . . On the particular night I have in mind, we were waiting for the top-floor light to go out. We wanted to see <name type="person">Avey</name> leave the flat. This night she stayed longer than usual and gave</p>

				<p><pb/>AVEY</p>
				<p>us a chance to complete the plans of how we were going to stone and beat that feller on the top floor out of town. <name type="person">Ned</name> especially had it in for him. He was about to throw a brick up at the window when at last the room went dark. Some minutes passed. Then <name type="person">Avey</name>, as unconcerned as if she had been paying an old-maid aunt a visit, came out. I don’t remember what she had on, and all that sort of thing. But I do know that I turned hot as bare pavements in the summertime at Ned’s boast: “Hell, bet I could get her too if you little niggers weren’t always spying and crabbing everything.” I didnt say a word to him. It wasnt my way then. I just stood there like the others, and something like a fuse burned up inside of me. She never noticed us, but swung along lazy and easy as anything. We sauntered to the corner and watched her till her door banged to. <name type="person">Ned</name> repeated what he’d said. I didnt seem to care. Sitting around old Mush-Head’s bread box, the discussion began. “Hang if I can see how she gets away with it,” <name type="person">Doc</name> started. Ned knew, of course. There was nothing he didnt know when it came to women. He dilated on the emotional needs of girls. Said</p>

				<p>they werent much different from men in that respect. And concluded with the solemn avowal: “It does em good.” None of us liked <name type="person">Ned</name> much. We all talked dirt; but it was the way he said it. And then too, a couple of the fellers had sisters and had caught <name type="person">Ned</name> playing with them. But there was no disputing the superiority of his smutty wisdom. <name type="person">Bubs Sanborn</name>, whose mother was friendly with Avey’s, had overhead the old ladies talking. “Avey’s mother’s ont her,” he said. We thought that only natural and began to guess at what would happen. Some one said she’d marry that feller on the top floor. <name type="person">Ned</name> called that a lie because <name type="person">Avey</name> was going to marry nobody but him. We had our doubts about that, but we did agree that she’d soon leave school and marry some one. The gang broke up, and I went home, picturing myself as married.</p>
				<p>Nothing I did seemed able to change Avey’s indifference to me. I played basket-ball, and when I’d make a long clean shot she’d clap with the others, louder than they, I thought. I’d meet her on the street, and there’d be no difference</p>

				<p>in the way she said hello. She never took the trouble to call me by my name. On the days for drill, I’d let my voice down a tone and call for a complicated maneuver when I saw her coming. She’d smile appreciation, but it was an impersonal smile, never for me. It was on a summer excursion down to <name type="place">Riverview</name> that she first seemed to take me into account. The day had been spent riding merry-go-rounds, scenic-rail-ways, and shoot-the-chutes. We had been in swimming and we had danced. I was a crack swimmer then. She didnt know how. I held her up and showed her how to kick her legs and draw her arms. Of course she didnt learn in one day, but she thanked me for bothering with her. I was also somewhat of a dancer. And I had already noticed that love can start on a dance floor. We danced. But though I held her tightly in my arms, she was way away. That college feller who lived on the top floor was somewhere making money for the next year. I imagined that she was thinking, wishing for him. <name type="person">Ned</name> was along. He treated her until his money gave out. She went with another feller. <name type="person">Ned</name> got sore. One by one the boys’ money gave</p>

				<p>out. She left them. And they got sore. Every one of them but me got sore. This is the reason, I guess, why I had her to myself on the top deck of the <name type="person">Jane Mosely</name> that night as we puffed up the <name type="place">Potomac</name>, coming home. The moon was brilliant. The air was sweet like clover. And every now and then, a salt tang, a stale drift of sea-weed. It was not my mind’s fault if it went romancing. I should have taken her in my arms the minute we were stowed in that old lifeboat. I dallied, dreaming. She took me in hers. And I could feel by the touch of it that it wasnt a man-to-woman love. It made me restless. I felt chagrined. I didnt know what it was, but I did know that I couldnt handle it. She ran her fingers through my hair and kissed my forehead. I itched to break through her tenderness to passion. I wanted her to take me in her arms as I knew she had that college feller. I wanted her to love me passionately as she did him. I gave her one burning kiss. Then she laid me in her lap as if I were a child. Helpless. I got sore when she started to hum a lullaby. She wouldnt let me go. I talked. I knew damned well that I could beat her at that. Her</p>

				<p>eyes were soft and misty, the curves of her lips were wistful, and her smile seemed indulgent of the irrelevance of my remarks. I gave up at last and let her love me, silently, in her own way. The moon was brilliant. The air was sweet like clover, and every now and then, a salt tang, a stale drift of sea-weed. . .</p>
				<p>The next time I came close to her was the following summer at <name type="place">Harpers Ferry</name>. We were sitting on a flat projecting rock they give the name of <name type="place">Lover’s Leap</name>. Some one is supposed to have jumped off it. The river is about six hundred feet beneath. A railroad track runs up the valley and curves out of sight where part of the mountain rock had to be blasted away to make room for it. The engines of this valley have a whistle, the echoes of which sound like iterated gasps and sobs. I always think of them as crude music from the soul of <name type="person">Avey</name>. We sat there holding hands. Our palms were soft and warm against each other. Our fingers were not tight. She would not let them be. She would not let me twist them. I wanted to talk. To explain what I meant to her. <name type="person">Avey</name> was as silent as those great trees whose tops we looked down</p>

				<p>upon. She has always been like that. At least, to me. I had the notion that if I really wanted to, I could do with her just what I pleased. Like one can strip a tree. I did kiss her. I even let my hands cup her breasts. When I was through, she’d seek my hand and hold it till my pulse cooled down. Evening after evening we sat there. I tried to get her to talk about that college feller. She never would. There was no set time to go home. None of my family had come down. And as for hers, she didnt give a hang about them. The general gossips could hardly say more than they had. The boarding-house porch was always deserted when we returned. No one saw us enter, so the time was set conveniently for scandal. This worried me a little, for I thought it might keep <name type="person">Avey</name> from getting an appointment in the schools. She didnt care. She had finished normal school. They could give her a job if they wanted to. As time went on, her indifference to things began to pique me; I was ambitious. I left the Ferry earlier than she did. I was going off to college. The more I thought of it, the more I resented, yes, hell, thats what it was, her downright laziness. Sloppy</p>

				<p>indolence. There was no excuse for a healthy girl taking life so easy. Hell! she was no better than a cow. I was certain that she was a cow when I felt an udder in a <name type="place">Wisconsin</name> stock-judging class. Among those energetic Swedes, or whatever they are, I decided to forget her. For two years I thought I did. When I’d come home for the summer she’d be away. And before she returned, I’d be gone. We never wrote; she was too damned lazy for that. But what a bluff I put up about forgetting her. The girls up that way, at least the ones I knew, havent got the stuff: they dont know how to love. Giving themselves completely was tame beside just the holding of Avey’s hand. One day I received a note from her. The writing, I decided, was slovenly. She wrote on a torn bit of note-book paper. The envelope had a faint perfume that I remembered. A single line told me she had lost her school and was going away. I comforted myself with the reflection that shame held no pain for one so indolent as she. Nevertheless, I left <name type="place">Wisconsin</name> that year for good. <name type="place">Washington</name> had seemingly forgotten her. I hunted <name type="person">Ned</name>. Between curses, I caught his opinion of</p>

				<p>her. She was no better than a whore. I saw her mother on the street. The same old pinchbeck, jerky-gaited creature that I’d always known.</p>
				<p>Perhaps five years passed. The business of hunting a job or something or other had bruised my vanity so that I could recognize it. I felt old. <name type="person">Avey</name> and my real relation to her, I thought I came to know. I wanted to see her. I had been told that she was in <name type="place">New York</name>. As I had no money, I hiked and bummed my way there. I got work in a ship-yard and walked the streets at night, hoping to meet her. Failing in this, I saved enough to pay my fare back home. One evening in early June, just at the time when dusk is most lovely on the eastern horizon, I saw <name type="person">Avey</name>, indolent as ever, leaning on the arm of a man, strolling under the recently lit arc-lights of <name type="place">U Street</name>. She had almost passed before she recognized me. She showed no surprise. The puff over her eyes had grown heavier. The eyes themselves were still sleepy-large, and beautiful. I had almost concluded—indifferent. “You look older,” was what she said. I wanted to con-</p>

				<p>vince her that I was, so I asked her to walk with me. The man whom she was with, and whom she never took the trouble to introduce, at a nod from her, hailed a taxi, and drove away. That gave me a notion of what she had been used to. Her dress was of some fine, costly stuff. I suggested the park, and then added that the grass might stain her skirt. Let it get stained, she said, for where it came from there are others.</p>
				<p>I have a spot in <name type="place">Soldier’s Home</name> to which I always go when I want the simple beauty of another’s soul. Robins spring about the lawn all day. They leave their footprints in the grass. I imagine that the grass at night smells sweet and fresh because of them. The ground is high. <name type="place">Washington</name> lies below. Its light spreads like a blush against the darkened sky. Against the soft dusk sky of <name type="place">Washington</name>. And when the wind is from the South, soil of my homeland falls like a fertile shower upon the lean streets of the city. Upon my hill in <name type="place">Soldier’s Home</name>. I know the policeman who watches the place of nights. When I go there alone, I talk to him. I tell him I come there to find the truth that people</p>

				<p>bury in their hearts. I tell him that I do not come there with a girl to do the thing he’s paid to watch out for. I look deep in his eyes when I say these things, and he believes me. He comes over to see who it is on the grass. I say hello to him. He greets me in the same way and goes off searching for other black splotches upon the lawn. Avey and I went there. A band in one of the buildings a fair distance off was playing a march. I wished they would stop. Their playing was like a tin spoon in one’s mouth. I wanted the Howard Glee Club to sing “Deep River,” from the road. To sing “Deep River, Deep River,” from the road. . . Other than the first comments, Avey had been silent. I started to hum a folk-tune. She slipped her hand in mine. Pillowed her head as best she could upon my arm. Kissed the hand that she was holding and listened, or so I thought, to what I had to say. I traced my development from the early days up to the present time, the phase in which I could understand her. I described her own nature and temperament. Told how they needed a larger life for their expression. How incapable <name type="place">Washington</name> was of un-</p>

				<p>derstanding that need. How it could not meet it. I pointed out that in lieu of proper channels, her emotions had overflowed into paths that dissipated them. I talked, beautifully I thought, about an art that would be born, an art that would open the way for women the likes of her. I asked her to hope, and build up an inner life against the coming of that day. I recited some of my own things to her. I sang, with a strange quiver in my voice, a promise-song. And then I began to wonder why her hand had not once returned a single pressure. My old-time feeling about her laziness came back. I spoke sharply. My policeman friend passed by. I said hello to him. As he went away, I began to visualize certain possibilities. An immediate and urgent passion swept over me. Then I looked at <name type="person">Avey</name>. Her heavy eyes were closed. Her breathing was as faint and regular as a child’s in slumber. My passion died. I was afraid to move lest I disturb her. Hours and hours, I guess it was, she lay there. My body grew numb. I shivered. I coughed. I wanted to get up and whittle at the boxes of young trees. I withdrew my hand. I raised her head to waken her. She</p>

He said it would be all right for her to stay there just so long as she got away before the workmen came at dawn. A blanket was borrowed from a neighbor house. I sat beside her through the night. I saw the dawn steal over <name type="place">Washington</name>. The Capitol dome looked like a gray ghost ship drifting in from sea. Avey’s face was pale, and her eyes were heavy. She did not have the gray crimson-splashed beauty of the dawn. I hated to wake her. Orphan-woman. . .</p>

				<p>LIFE of nigger alleys, of pool rooms and restaurants and near-beer saloons soaks into the walls of <name type="place">Howard Theater</name> and sets them throbbing jazz songs. Black-skinned, they dance and shout above the tick and trill of white-walled buildings. At night, they open doors to people who come in to stamp their feet and shout. At night, road-shows volley songs into the mass-heart of black people. Songs soak the walls and seep out to the nigger life of alleys and near-beer saloons, of the Poodle Dog and Black Bear cabarets. Afternoons, the house is dark, and the walls are sleeping singers until rehearsal begins. Or until <name type="person">John</name> comes within them. Then they start throbbing to a subtle syncopation. And the space-dark air grows softly luminous.</p>

Other chorus girls drift in. <name type="person">John</name> feels them in the mass. And as if his own body were the mass-heart of a black audience listening to them singing, he wants to stamp his feet and shout. His mind, contained above desires of his body, singles the girls out, and tries to trace origins and plot destinies.</p>

They glide off with footfalls softened on the leaves, the old leaves powdered by a million satin slippers.</p>
				<p>They are in a room. <name type="person">John</name> knows nothing of it. Only, that the flesh and blood of <name type="person">Dorris</name> are its walls. Singing walls. Lights, soft, as if they shine through clear pink fingers. Soft lights, and warm.</p>
				<p><name type="person">John</name> reaches for a manuscript of his, and reads. <name type="person">Dorris</name>, who has no eyes, has eyes to understand him. He comes to a dancing scene. The scene is <name type="person">Dorris</name>. She dances.</p>

I’ve seen it tagging on behind her, up streets where chestnut trees flowered, where dusty asphalt had been freshly sprinkled with clean water. Up alleys where niggers sat on low door-steps before tumbled shanties and sang and loved. At night, when she comes home, the little dog is left in the vestibule, nosing the crack beneath the big storm door, filled with chills till morning.

The eyes of houses faintly touch him as he passes them. Soft girl-eyes, they set him singing. Girl-eyes within him widen upward to promised faces. Floating away, they dally wistfully over the dusk body of the street. Come on, <name type="person">Dan Moore</name>, come on. <name type="person">Dan</name> sings. His voice is a little hoarse.</p>

He waits. No one comes. Perhaps they havent heard him. He raps again. This time, harder. He waits. No one comes. Some one is surely in. He fancies that he sees their shadows on the glass. Shadows of gorillas. Perhaps they saw him coming and dont want to let him in. He knocks. The tension of his arms makes the glass rattle. Hurried steps come towards him.

It is a sharp-edged, massed, metallic house. Bolted. About <name type="person">Mrs. Pribby</name>. Bolted to the endless rows of metal houses. Mrs. Pribby’s house.

				<p>“Happy, <name type="person">Muriel</name>? No, not happy. Your aim is wrong. There is no such thing as happiness.

				<p>People come in slowly . . . “—for my Sunday-go-to-meeting dress. O glory God! O shout Amen!” . . . and fill vacant seats of <name type="place">Lincoln Theater</name>. Each one is a bolt that shoots into a slot, and is locked there. Suppose the Lord should ask, where was <name type="person">Moses</name> when the light went out? Suppose <name type="person">Gabriel</name> should blow his trumpet! The seats are slots. The seats are bolted houses. The mass grows denser. Its weight at first is impalpable upon the box. Then <name type="person">Muriel</name> begins to feel it. She props her arm against the brass box-rail, to ward it off. Silly. These people are friends of hers: a parent of a child she teaches, an old school friend. She smiles at them. They return her courtesy, and she is free to chat with <name type="person">Berny</name>. Berny’s tongue, started, runs on, and on. O washer-blue! O washer-lady!</p>

				<p><pb/>BOX SEAT</p>
				<p>close beside a portly Negress whose huge rolls of flesh meet about the bones of seat-arms. A soil-soaked fragrance comes from her. Through the cement floor her strong roots sink down. They spread under the asphalt streets. Dreaming, the streets roll over on their bellies, and suck their glossy health from them. Her strong roots sink down and spread under the river and disappear in blood-lines that waver south. Her roots shoot down. Dan’s hands follow them. Roots throb. Dan’s heart beats violently. He places his palms upon the earth to cool them. Earth throbs. Dan’s heart beats violently. He sees all the people in the house rush to the walls to listen to the rumble. A new-world Christ is coming up. <name type="person">Dan</name> comes up. He is startled. The eyes of the woman dont belong to her. They look at him unpleasantly. From either aisle, bolted masses press in. He doesnt fit. The mass grows agitant. For an instant, Dan’s and Muriel’s eyes meet. His weight there slides the weight on her. She braces an arm against the brass rail, and turns her head away.</p>

				<p>“Keep quiet, cant you, mister. Other people have paid their money besides yourself to see the show.”</p>
				<p>The man’s face is a blur about two sullen liquid things that are his eyes. The eyes dissolve in the surrounding vagueness. <name type="person">Dan</name> suddenly feels that the man is an enemy whom he has long been looking for.</p>

They are going to fight for the heavyweight championship. Gruesome. <name type="person">Dan</name> glances at <name type="person">Muriel</name>. He imagines that she shudders.

Sometimes I think, <name type="person">Dan Moore</name>, that your eyes could burn clean . . . burn clean . . . BURN CLEAN! . .</p>
				<p>The gong rings. The dwarfs set to. They spar grotesquely, playfully, until one lands a stiff blow. This makes the other sore. He commences slugging. A real scrap is on. Time! The dwarfs go to their corners and are sponged and fanned off. Gloves bulge from their wrists. Their wrists are necks for the tightfaced gloves.

But is it not queer, this pale purple facsimile of a red-blooded Norwegian friend of his? Perhaps for some reason, white skins are not supposed to live at night.

Some distance off, down in the valley, a band of pine-smoke, silvered gauze, drifts steadily. The half-moon is a white child that sleeps upon the tree-tops of the forest.

The large frame house, squatting on brick pillars, where the principal of the school, his wife, and the boarding girls sleep, seems a curious shadow of his mind. He tries, but cannot convince himself of its reality. His gaze drifts down into the vale, across the swamp, up over the solid dusk bank of pines, and rests, bewildered-like, on the court-house tower. It is dull silver in the moonlight. White child that sleeps upon the top of pines. <name type="person">Kabnis</name>’ mind clears. He sees himself yanked beneath that tower. He sees white minds, with indolent assumption, juggle justice and a nigger. . . Somewhere, far off in the straight line of his sight, is <name type="place">Augusta</name>. <name type="person">Christ</name>, how cut off from everything he is. And hours, hours north, why not say a lifetime north? <name type="place">Washington</name> sleeps. Its still, peaceful streets, how desirable they are.

					<p>Thinking that now he can go to sleep, he re-enters his room. He builds a fire in the open hearth. The room dances to the tongues of flames, and sings to the crackling and spurting of the logs. Wind comes up between the floor boards, through the black cracks of the walls.</p>
					<p><name type="person">Kabnis</name>: Cant sleep. Light a cigarette. If that old bastard comes over here and smells smoke, I’m done for. Hell of a note, cant even smoke. The stillness of it: where they burn and hang men, you cant smoke. Cant take a swig of licker. What do they think this is, anyway, some sort of temperance school? How did I ever land in such a hole? Ugh. One might just as well be in his grave. Still as a grave. Jesus, how still everything is. Does the world know how still it is? People make noise. They are afraid of silence.

They rationalize their fear, and call their cowardice science. Fine bunch, they are. Damit, that was a noise. And not the wind either. A chicken maybe. Hell, chickens dont wander around this time of night. What in hell is it?</p>
					<p>A scraping sound, like a piece of wood dragging over the ground, is coming near.</p>
					<p>“Ha, ha. The ghosts down this way havent got any chains to rattle, so they drag trees along with them. Thats a good one. But no joke, something is outside this house, as sure as hell.

					<p>The parlor of <name type="person">Fred Halsey</name>’s home. There is a seediness about it. It seems as though the fittings have given a frugal service to at least seven generations of middle-class shop-owners. An open grate burns cheerily in contrast to the gray cold changed autumn weather. An old-fashioned mantelpiece supports a family clock (not running), a figure or two in imitation bronze, and two small group pictures. Directly above it, in a heavy oak frame, the portrait of a bearded man. Black hair, thick and curly, intensifies the pallor of the high forehead. The eyes are daring. The nose, sharp and regular. The poise suggests a tendency to adventure checked by the necessities of absolute command. The portrait is that of an English gentleman who has retained much of his culture, in that</p>

					<p>money has enabled him to escape being drawn through a land-grubbing pioneer life. His nature and features, modified by marriage and circumstances, have been transmitted to his great-grandson, <name type="person">Fred</name>. To the left of this picture, spaced on the wall, is a smaller portrait of the great-grandmother. That here there is a Negro strain, no one would doubt. But it is difficult to say in precisely what feature it lies. On close inspection, her mouth is seen to be wistfully twisted. The expression of her face seems to shift before one’s gaze—now ugly, repulsive; now sad, and somehow beautiful in its pain. A tin wood-box rests on the floor below. To the right of the great-grandfather’s portrait hangs a family group: the father, mother, two brothers, and one sister of <name type="person">Fred</name>. It includes himself some thirty years ago when his face was an olive white, and his hair luxuriant and dark and wavy. The father is a rich brown. The mother, practically white. Of the children, the girl, quite young, is like <name type="person">Fred</name>; the two brothers, darker. The walls of the room are plastered and painted green. An old upright piano is tucked into the corner near the window. The window looks out</p>

					<p>on a forlorn, box-like, whitewashed frame church. Negroes are gathering, on foot, driving questionable gray and brown mules, and in an occasional Ford, for afternoon service. Beyond, <name type="place">Georgia</name> hills roll off into the distance, their dreary aspect heightened by the gray spots of unpainted one- and two-room shanties. Clumps of pine trees here and there are the dark points the whole landscape is approaching. The church bell tolls. Above its squat tower, a great spiral of buzzards reaches far into the heavens. An ironic comment upon the path that leads into the Christian land. . . Three rocking chairs are grouped around the grate. Sunday papers scattered on the floor indicate a recent usage. <name type="person">Halsey</name>, a well-built, stocky fellow, hair cropped close, enters the room. His Sunday clothes smell of wood and glue, for it is his habit to potter around his wagon-shop even on the Lord’s day. He is followed by <name type="person">Professor Layman,</name> tall, heavy, loose-jointed <name type="place">Georgia</name> Negro, by turns teacher and preacher, who has traveled in almost every nook and corner of the state and hence knows more than would be good for anyone other than a silent man. <name type="person">Kabnis</name>, trying to</p>

					<p>A shriek pierces the room. The bronze pieces on the mantel hum. The sister cries frantically: “<name type="person">Jesus</name>, <name type="person">Jesus</name>, I’ve found <name type="person">Jesus</name>. O <name type="person">Lord</name>, glory t <name type="person">God</name>, one mo sinner is acomin home.’ At the height of this, a stone, wrapped round with paper, crashes through the window. <name type="person">Kabnis</name> springs to his feet, terror-stricken. <name type="person">Layman</name> is worried. <name type="person">Halsey</name> picks up the stone. Takes off the wrapper, smooths it out, and reads: “You northern nigger, its time fer y t leave. Git along now.” <name type="person">Kabnis</name> knows that the command is meant for him. Fear squeezes him. Caves him in. As a violent external pressure would. Fear flows inside him. It fills him up. He bloats. He saves himself from bursting by dashing wildly from the room. <name type="person">Halsey</name> and <name type="person">Layman</name> stare stupidly at each other. The stone, the</p>

					<p>crumpled paper are things, huge things that weight them. Their thoughts are vaguely concerned with the texture of the stone, with the color of the paper. Then they remember the words, and begin to shift them about in sentences. <name type="person">Layman</name> even construes them grammatically. Suddenly the sense of them comes back to <name type="person">Halsey</name>. He grips <name type="person">Layman</name> by the arm and they both follow after <name type="person">Kabnis</name>.</p>
					<p>A false dusk has come early. The countryside is ashen, chill. Cabins and roads and canebrakes whisper. The church choir, dipping into a long silence, sings:</p>
					<l>My Lord, what a mourning,</l>
					<l>My Lord, what a mourning,</l>
					<l>My Lord, what a mourning,</l>
					<l>When the stars begin to fall.</l>
					<p>Softly luminous over the hills and valleys, the faint spray of a scattered star. . .</p>

					<p>scarecrow replica of <name type="person">Kabnis</name>, awkwardly animate. Fantastically plastered with red <name type="place">Georgia</name> mud. It skirts the big house whose windows shine like mellow lanterns in the dusk. Its shoulder jogs against a sweet-gum tree. The figure caroms off against the cabin door, and lunges in. It slams the door as if to prevent some one entering after it.</p>
					<p>“<name type="person">God Almighty</name>, theyre here. After me. On me. All along the road I saw their eyes flaring from the cane. Hounds. Shouts. What in <name type="person">God</name>’s name did I run here for? A mud-hole trap. I stumbled on a rope. O <name type="person">God</name>, a rope. Their clammy hands were like the love of death playing up and down my spine. Trying to trip my legs. To trip my spine. Up and down my spine. My spine. . . My legs. . .

					<p>He throws the broom aside and grips the poker. Starts towards the closet door, towards somewhere in the perfect blackness behind the chimney.</p>
					<p>“I’ll brain you.”</p>
					<p>He stops short. The barks of hounds, evidently in pursuit, reach him. A voice, liquid in distance, yells, “Hi! Hi!”</p>
					<p>“O <name type="person">God</name>, theyre after me. <name type="person">Holy Father</name>, <name type="person">Mother of Christ</name>—hell, this aint no time for prayer—”</p>

He almost spills the bottle, but manages to pass it to <name type="person">Halsey</name> just as the door swings open and <name type="person">Hanby</name> enters. He is a well-dressed, smooth, rich, black-skinned Negro who thinks there is no one quite so suave and polished as himself. To members of his own race, he affects the manners of a wealthy white planter. Or, when he is up <name type="place">North</name>, he lets it be known that his ideas are those of the best <name type="place">New England</name> tradition. To white men he bows, without ever completely humbling himself. Tradesmen in the town tolerate him because he spends his money with them.

					<p>come straight to the point: the progress of the Negro race is jeopardized whenever the personal habits and examples set by its guides and mentors fall below the acknowledged and hard-won standard of its average member. This institution, of which I am the humble president, was founded, and has been maintained at a cost of great labor and untold sacrifice. Its purpose is to teach our youth to live better, cleaner, more noble lives. To prove to the world that the Negro race can be just like any other race. It hopes to attain this aim partly by the salutary examples set by its instructors. I cannot hinder the progress of a race simply to indulge a single member. I have thought the matter out beforehand, I can assure you. Therefore, if I find your resignation on my desk by to-morrow morning, <name type="person">Mr. Kabnis</name>, I shall not feel obliged to call in the sheriff. Otherwise. . . ”</p>

The walls to within a few feet of the ground are of an age-worn cement mixture. On the outside they are considerably crumbled and peppered with what looks like musket-shot.

					<p>for the rain and sunshine which otherwise would have free entry to the main floor. The shop is filled with old wheels and parts of wheels, broken shafts, and wooden litter. A double door, midway the street wall. To the left of this, a work-bench that holds a vise and a variety of wood-work tools. A window with as many panes broken as whole, throws light on the bench. Opposite, in the rear wall, a second window looks out upon the back yard. In the left wall, a rickety smoke-blackened chimney, and hearth with fire blazing. Smooth-worn chairs grouped about the hearth suggest the village meeting-place. Several large wooden blocks, chipped and cut and sawed on their upper surfaces are in the middle of the floor. They are the supports used in almost any sort of wagon-work. Their idleness means that <name type="person">Halsey</name> has no worth-while job on foot. To the right of the central door is a junk heap, and directly behind this, stairs that lead down into the cellar. The cellar is known as “<name type="place">The Hole</name>.” Besides being the home of a very old man, it is used by <name type="person">Halsey</name> on those occasions when he spices up the life of the small town.</p>

					<p><name type="person">Layman</name> squares a chair to the fire and droops into it. Several town fellows, silent unfathomable men for the most part, saunter in. Overalls. Thick tan shoes. Felt hats marvelously shaped and twisted. One asks <name type="person">Halsey</name> for a cigarette. He gets it. The blacksmith, a tremendous black man, comes in from the forge. Not even a nod from him. He picks up an axle and goes out. <name type="person">Lewis</name> enters. The town men look curiously at him. Suspicion and an open liking contest for possession of their faces. They are uncomfortable. One by one they drift into the street.</p>

					<p>She passes the window. Her red girl’s-cap, catching the sun, flashes vividly. With a stiff, awkward little movement she crosses the door-sill and gives <name type="person">Kabnis</name> one of the two baskets which she is carrying. There is a slight stoop to her shoulders. The curves of her body blend with this to a soft rounded charm. Her gestures are stiffly variant. Black bangs curl over the forehead of her oval-olive face. Her expression is dazed, but on provocation it can melt into a wistful smile. Adolescent. She is easily the sister of <name type="person">Fred Halsey</name>.</p>

					<p>Their meeting is a swift sun-burst. <name type="person">Lewis</name> impulsively moves towards her. His mind flashes images of her life in the southern town. He sees the nascent woman, her flesh already stiffening to cartilage, drying to bone. Her spirit-bloom, even now touched sullen, bitter. Her rich beauty fading. . . He wants to— He stretches forth his hands to hers. He takes them. They feel like warm cheeks against his palms. The sun-burst from her eyes floods up and haloes him. <name type="person">Christ</name>-eyes, his eyes look to her. Fearlessly she loves into them. And then something happens. Her face blanches. Awkwardly she draws away. The sin-bogies of respectable southern colored folks clamor at her: “Look out! Be a good girl. A good girl. Look out!” She gropes for her basket that has fallen to the floor. Finds it, and marches with a rigid gravity to her task of feeding the old man. Like the glowing white ash of burned paper, <name type="person">Lewis</name>’ eyelids, wavering, settle down. He stirs in the direction of the rear window. From the back yard, mules tethered to odd trees and posts blink dumbly at him.

					<p>The cellar swims in a pale phosphorescence. The table, the chairs, the figure of the old man are amoeba-like shadows which move about and float in it.

The wagon draws him. He lifts an oak-beam, fingers it, and becomes abstracted. Then comes to himself and places the beam upon the workbench. He looks over some newly cut wooden spokes. He goes to the fire and pokes it. The coals are red-hot. With a pair of long prongs he picks them up and places them in a thick iron bucket. This he carries downstairs. Outside, darkness has given way to the impalpable grayness of dawn. This early morning light, seeping through the four barred cellar windows, is the color of the stony walls.

The girls, before the mirror, are doing up their hair. It is bushy hair that has gone through some straightening process. Character, however, has not all been ironed out. As they kneel there, heavy-eyed and dusky, and throwing grotesque moving shadows on the wall, they are two princesses in <name type="place">Africa</name> going through the early-morning ablutions of their pagan prayers.

What does it mean t you? Youre dead already. Death. What does it mean t you? To you who died way back there in th 'sixties. What are y throwin it in my throat for? Whats it goin t get y? A good smashin in th mouth, thats what. My fist'll sink int y black mush face clear t y guts-if y got any. Dont believe y have. Never seen signs of none. Death. Death. Sin an Death. All night long y mumbled death. (He forgets the old man as his mind begins to play with the word and its associations.) Death . . . these clammy floors . . . just like th place they used t stow away th worn-out, no-count niggers in th days of slavery ... that was long ago; not so long ago . . . no windows (he rises higher on his elbows to verify this assertion.

Ditch y when it comes right down t it. Damn him anyway. Godam him. (He looks and re-sees the old man.) Eh, you? T hell with you too. What do I care whether you can see or hear? You know what hell is cause youve been there. Its a feelin an its ragin in my soul in a way that’ll pop out of me an run you through, an scorch y, an burn an rip your soul. Your soul. Ha. Nigger soul. A gin soul that gets drunk on a preacher’s words. An screams. An shouts. <name type="person">God Almighty</name>, how I hate that shoutin. Where’s th beauty in that? Gives a buzzard a windpipe an I’ll bet a dollar t a dime th buzzard ud beat y to it. Aint surprisin th white folks hate y so. When you had eyes, did you ever see th beauty of th world? Tell me that. Th hell y did. Now dont tell me. I know y didnt. You couldnt have. Oh, I’m drunk an just as good as dead, but no eyes that have seen beauty ever lose their sight. You aint got no sight. If you had, drunk as I am, I hope <name type="person">Christ</name> will kill me if I couldnt see it. Your eyes are dull and watery, like fish</p>

					<p>Some one is coming down the stairs. <name type="person">Carrie</name>, bringing food for the old man.

He hangs it, with an exaggerated ceremony, on its nail in the corner. He looks down on the tousled beds. His lips curl bitterly. Turning, he stumbles over the bucket of dead coals. He savagely jerks it from the floor. And then, seeing <name type="person">Carrie</name>'s eyes upon him, he swings the pail carelessly and with eyes downcast and swollen, trudges upstairs to the work-shop. <name type="person">Carrie</name>'s gaze follows him till he is gone. Then she goes to the old man and slips to her knees before him. Her lips murmur, "<name type="person">Jesus</name>, come." </p>

					<p>Outside, the sun arises from its cradle in the tree-tops of the forest. Shadows of pines are dreams the sun shakes from its eyes. The sun arises. Gold-glowing child, it steps into the sky and sends a birth-song slanting down gray dust streets and sleepy windows of the southern town. </p>
